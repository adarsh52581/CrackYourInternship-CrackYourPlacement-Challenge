# Implement a simple text editor. The editor initially contains an empty string, . Perform  operations of the following  types:

# append - Append string  to the end of .
# delete - Delete the last  characters of .
# print - Print the  character of .
# undo - Undo the last (not previously undone) operation of type  or , reverting  to the state it was in prior to that operation.
q=int(input())
S =""
last_s=[]

for _ in range(q):
    t=list(input().split())
    if t[0]=='1':
        last_s.append(S)
        S=S+t[1]
    elif t[0]=='2':
        last_s.append(S)
        S=S[:-int(t[1])]
    elif t[0]=='3':
        k = int(t[1])-1

    else:

# Steps
# 1. Same as stack using 2 queues algo
# 2. Implement the menu driven if-else clause
